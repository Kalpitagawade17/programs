        <h3>The Beginning:Online Excerpts - a Novel Concept!</h3>
    </div>
    
    
    <div class="content1div">
        <p>In the years BC (before children) one of our greatest pleasures was going together to browse the shelves in the bookstore or library, taking our time to pick out books that looked interesting and browsing a few pages to decide which we wanted to take home. But after the arrival of our two children, lengthy visits to anything other than the kid's section became rare. </p>

<p>Back in 1997, we arrived home from a far from relaxing visit to the bookstore (because the four year old wanted to go off exploring and the two year old decided that an afternoon nap wasn't on the agenda after all). Surely, we thought, there must be another way, and perhaps this newfangled thing called the world wide web was the answer? So, we dialed up our internet connection and started to search for information on books - but it was so limited - usually all that was available was the description from the back of the book. </p>
        
<p>We asked ourselves, why can't we browse through a few pages of a book online just as we can in the bookstore or library? And, finding we couldn't, we resolved to create a website that would bring booklovers excerpts of books. But that was just the start...

            <p>Being able to read a few pages of a book is a must, but it's also interesting to see what others are saying, so we gather together every review we can find about a book we're featuring, and abbreviate each to its salient point of view (removing all that irritating plot detail, and more often than not spoilers) - so that you can see what the mainstream media are saying about each book at a quick glance. Of course, the media aren't the only ones with opinions worth hearing, so visitors can write their own reviews as well. </p>

    <div class="content3div">
            <p>For a book to capture our interest, then and now, it needs to go beyond just telling a good story, it needs to give us a window to explore the lives of others or a mirror to reflect on our own - so, when we finish it we know something about the world or ourselves we didn't before. Such books can't be contained within restrictive boundaries so we feature books from a wide range of genres, both fiction and nonfiction.

        <h3>Another First: Reviews and Beyond the Book</h3>
    </div>
    
    <div class="content4div">
            <p>Although initially we didn't review books ourselves, we found ourselves frustrated with many of the reviews written by the mainstream media - sometimes they'd be all plot and no opinion, other times it would seem that the reviewer was more interested in showing us how clever he or she was than actually helping us decide which books we wanted to read. So when we started to write our own reviews, we decided to focus less on plot and much more on
            the characters, themes, writing style and overall experience of reading the book - always with the aim of helping you decide if it's right for you! </p>
        <p>
Because we read to explore, we would often find ourselves turning the last page of the book and wanting to investigate things we'd just read about. So, in addition to reviewing books, we go "beyond the book" to explore topics from the book and to answer questions we have after reading it. Happily, we've found that we're not alone in enjoying such tangents and that a great many readers also enjoy going "beyond the book". So we include one for every book we feature. Members tell us they enjoy reading these articles whether they've read the book in question or not. In fact, many will read the beyond the book articles even when they have no particular interest in the book itself because the articles stand along as interesting pieces of writing. We also, whenever possible, include an interview so that you can hear from the authors in their own words.

    <div class="content5div">
            <p>From the start we decided we didn't want to sell books because doing so might skew the books we chose to feature to those destined to sell the most copies which, to be frank, are often not the books that we think are the best. We also decided that we wouldn't accept payments for our editorial staff to review books as we never wanted to feel under pressure to write a more positive review than was warranted. To this day we have remained independent, without affiliation to any publisher or bookseller, and without any investors pushing us in directions we're not comfortable with. You will see links on BookBrowse to buy books. These are for the convenience of our visitors - the commission that is generated is donated to charity.</p>
